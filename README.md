This is an example of using the reywood:publish-composite meteor package.

It includes enough to run the meteor application, insert the database records, and then navigate around the site to show off publishComposite.

I've created this to evaluate the use of publishComposite for publishing all related data in a reactive manner. Future work: using a composite publication which returns more than one record and performance testing to see how the application handles any load.
