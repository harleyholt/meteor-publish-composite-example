Replace graphite with graphana in order to script the creation of dashboards when deploying

Ultimate goal: Want to be able to test the performance of a meteor application in an automated way.
Want graphs and aggregated statistics to be output.

How does the server handle a change when there are x numbers of subscriptions?
How long does it take to subscribe to a collection of y documents?
What is the memory usage of reactive vs. unreactive publications?

I want to be able to correlate those graphs to what is happening both on the server and actions
being performed by the client.
